//! The canonical GHOST transaction — the protocol constant that pads a

//!
//! Two same-tier blocks with different REAL transaction counts must
//! assemble to one fixed proof class (the fixed-matrix invariant), so
//! every per-transaction slot past the real count is filled with THIS
//! transaction: its spine chain joins the tx-body killshot batch, its
//! selected ZK authorization joins the production authorization slots, and
//! its statement lanes
//! are the constants below. Ghost slots are marked dead by liveness
//! selectors — they never touch state, never enter the tx root, and
//! contribute zero to every resource total.
//!
//! SECURITY: the ghost spend secret is DELIBERATELY PUBLIC — it is a
//! protocol constant, not a wallet secret. It authorizes only the ghost
//! body defined here, which spends a slot that never exists in any
//! chain state (liveness gating keeps ghost slots out of all state
//! semantics), so knowing the "secret" grants nothing. Real wallet
//! secrets never leave wallets; this constant is not one of them.
